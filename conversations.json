      "bot_response": "*Math Mode* Certainly! Let's start with a similar problem to help you understand the process. **Example Problem:** Solve the equation \\( x + 3 = 7 \\). **Step 1:** Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation. \\[ x + 3 - 3 = 7 - 3 \\] \\[ x = 4 \\] Now, let's apply the same steps to your problem: \\( 2x = 4 \\). **Step 1:** Divide both sides by 2. \\[ \\frac{2x}{2} = \\frac{4}{2} \\] **Step 2:** Simplify both sides. \\[ x = 2 \\] Now, try to solve the equation \\( 2x = 4 \\) yourself using the steps above. Subtract 3 from both sides first, then divide by 2. Let's go through it step by step: 1. Start with the equation: \\( 2x = 4 \\). 2. Divide both sides by 2: \\( \\frac{2x}{2} = \\frac{4}{2} \\). What do you get for the value of \\( x \\)?",
